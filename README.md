# Leetcode DSA Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository!  
I created this repo to prepare for top tech companies like Amazon, focusing on **DSA patterns**, **Java-based solutions**, and **consistent progress tracking**.

## üß† Goals

- Solve at least **15-20 quality problems per week**
- Focus on Amazon/Microsoft/Google tagged questions
- Master key DSA patterns and system design concepts
- Write clean and optimized Java code
